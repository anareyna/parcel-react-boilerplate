# Parcel JS + React boilerplate 😎

a boilerplate for using `Parcel JS` for creating `React` apps!

* React 16
* styled-components && css-modules
* react-hot-loader that works 🎉
* prettier && eslint

Gets you up and running with `Parcel JS` quickly! 🏃

Currently the boilerplate makes use of `pug`, `stylus` and `es6/babel`. But these could easily be swapped out/removed based on your requirements.

The idea is that _you_ will fork your own version and adapt it to fit your requirements 👍

## Usage

As a prerequisite it's assumed you have `npm/yarn` installed and the `gulp-cli`.

1. Clone the repo

        git clone https://github.com/jh3y/parcel-react-boilerplate.git

2. Install dependencies

        npm install / yarn

3. Start

        make develop

## Tasks
The boilerplate makes uses of a self-documented `Makefile`. You can see all available tasks with `make` 😎
